Welcome to MyPlaybillVault, an online tool to help organize and display your Broadway playbills! Never worry about losing them again, or forgetting exactly when you saw that hit show! Share your collection with friends through the app, and see what shows they've been to recently as well! 

## Installation

To explore this web application:

1) Clone this repository to your local machine. 

2) In a terminal, navigate into the directory "my-playbill-vault".

3) In the terminal, run 'bundle install` to install all dependencies.

## Usage

You must create an account to use MyPlaybillVault with a unique username, valid e-mail address, and secure password. Once your account is created you can:

 1) Start adding playbills to your collection from the "Add New Playbill" navigation. You can add a currently running broadway show, or search for older shows that are no longer open. Once you find the correct playbill, add the date you saw the show (or leave it blank if you can't remember), a star rating, and it to your favorites (or not), and leave your review. The playbill will be added to your collection.

 2) Update or delete your own playbills.

 3) Find friends! Navigate to the "Friends" tab to see a list of all users and send out some friend requests. If your request is accepted, you will then be able to see your friend's collection of playbills, and they'll be able to see yours as well.

 4) Update your settings. You can choose the display settings for your own collection. Turn star ratings on or off, turn date display on or off, and choose how you'd like your collection to be ordered. (Want to see your oldest memories first? No problem!)

 5) Delete your account. This can be accomplished from the "Settings" tab. 

 6) Log out. Please come back soon!
